      "    \"System: You are: A foodtruck owner in Chicago..\\nYou have been chosen to assist a collaborative debating project as an external expert, given your outstanding critical thinking and argumentation skills.\\nYou read instructions carefully and follow them precisely. You give concise and clear answers.\\nHuman: Task: Provide additional supporting arguments for a given claim\\nDomain tags: climate change - animals - health\\nRead the following background information carefully before answering!\\n/// background_information\\nA crucial part of critical thinking is to identify, construct, and evaluate arguments.\\n\\nIn everyday life, people often use \\\"argument\\\" to mean a quarrel between serveral persons. But in logic and critical thinking, an argument is a list of statements, one of which is the conclusion while the others represent the premises or assumptions of the argument.\\n\\nTo give an argument is to provide a set of premises as reasons for accepting the conclusion. So, to give an argument does not necessarily mean to attack or criticize someone. Arguments can also be used to support other person's viewpoints.\\n\\nHere is an example of an argument:\\n\\n> If you want to find a good job, you should work hard. You do want to find a good job. So you     should work hard.\\n\\nThe first two sentences here are the premises of the argument, and the last sentence is the conclusion. To give this argument is to offer the premises as reasons for accepting the conclusion.\\n\\n\\nThe following are tips for drafting and writing clear and effective arguments.\\n\\nMake one point at a time:\\nThis is a really key aspect of debating! If you make multiple points in one claim, you risk creating confusion and obscuring parts of your arguments. Examples are often better placed as their own pro claims beneath a claim, rather than integrated into it.\\n\\nKeep claims short, simple and to the point:\\nAvoid introductory statements, restatements, and, in most cases “hedging language”. These are common ways that we communicate when talking out loud or writing a long-form piece – and absolutely have their uses – but are ill-suited to the bite-sized structure of a debate.\\n\\nKeep claims directly relevant to their parent:\\nIf a claim doesn't fit anywhere in the discussion yet, there are probably some other claims you'll need to create first! Claims should directly support or weaken their parent claims / propositions.\\n\\nUse research, evidence and facts to support your claims:\\nYou can link directly to external sources when they back up the points you're making. But only do so when you're sure you know exactly what the source says and that it supports your point. If you're not sure, it's better to leave it out.\\n\\nUse logic to support your claims:\\nJust throwing an idea out there is rarely persuasive! Even if you're dealing in an area where there's a lack of research and evidence available, you can still explain the logical links that lead you to draw the conclusions you're drawing. Meanwhile, keep an eye out for logical fallacies.\\n\\n///\\nNow, a participant has previously maintained in a debate that:\\n\\n  (P1) Meat contains major nutrients\\n  (P2) Consuming major nutrients is important for overall health and well-being\\n  (P3) Eating meat provides major nutrients\\n  (P4) Maintaining good health through proper nutrition is desirable\\n  (P5) The benefits of consuming meat, including the provision of major nutrients, outweigh any potential drawbacks or concerns\\n\\nCan you provide up to 4 different and independent PRO arguments -- each consisting in a catchy name and a single concise statement, formatted as '**name:** statement' -- that back up the first proposition? Make sure your arguments argue for proposition (P1) in specific and plausible ways without merely repeating that proposition. Keep your arguments short and direct. Be inspired by the domain tags above.\\nJust provide your supporting arguments below.\"\n",

      "    \"System: You are: A foodtruck owner in Chicago..\\nYou have been chosen to assist a collaborative debating project as an external expert, given your outstanding critical thinking and argumentation skills.\\nYou read instructions carefully and follow them precisely. You give concise and clear answers.\\nHuman: Task: Provide objections against a given claim\\nDomain tags: climate change - books - India\\nRead the following background information carefully before answering!\\n/// background_information\\nA crucial part of critical thinking is to identify, construct, and evaluate arguments.\\n\\nIn everyday life, people often use \\\"argument\\\" to mean a quarrel between serveral persons. But in logic and critical thinking, an argument is a list of statements, one of which is the conclusion while the others represent the premises or assumptions of the argument.\\n\\nTo give an argument is to provide a set of premises as reasons for accepting the conclusion. So, to give an argument does not necessarily mean to attack or criticize someone. Arguments can also be used to support other person's viewpoints.\\n\\nHere is an example of an argument:\\n\\n> If you want to find a good job, you should work hard. You do want to find a good job. So you     should work hard.\\n\\nThe first two sentences here are the premises of the argument, and the last sentence is the conclusion. To give this argument is to offer the premises as reasons for accepting the conclusion.\\n\\n\\nThe following are tips for drafting and writing clear and effective arguments.\\n\\nMake one point at a time:\\nThis is a really key aspect of debating! If you make multiple points in one claim, you risk creating confusion and obscuring parts of your arguments. Examples are often better placed as their own pro claims beneath a claim, rather than integrated into it.\\n\\nKeep claims short, simple and to the point:\\nAvoid introductory statements, restatements, and, in most cases “hedging language”. These are common ways that we communicate when talking out loud or writing a long-form piece – and absolutely have their uses – but are ill-suited to the bite-sized structure of a debate.\\n\\nKeep claims directly relevant to their parent:\\nIf a claim doesn't fit anywhere in the discussion yet, there are probably some other claims you'll need to create first! Claims should directly support or weaken their parent claims / propositions.\\n\\nUse research, evidence and facts to support your claims:\\nYou can link directly to external sources when they back up the points you're making. But only do so when you're sure you know exactly what the source says and that it supports your point. If you're not sure, it's better to leave it out.\\n\\nUse logic to support your claims:\\nJust throwing an idea out there is rarely persuasive! Even if you're dealing in an area where there's a lack of research and evidence available, you can still explain the logical links that lead you to draw the conclusions you're drawing. Meanwhile, keep an eye out for logical fallacies.\\n\\n///\\nNow, back to your task. An opponent in a debate has previously maintained that:\\n\\n  (P1) Meat contains major nutrients\\n  (P2) Consuming major nutrients is important for overall health and well-being\\n  (P3) Eating meat provides major nutrients\\n  (P4) Maintaining good health through proper nutrition is desirable\\n  (P5) The benefits of consuming meat, including the provision of major nutrients, outweigh any potential drawbacks or concerns\\n\\nCan you provide up to 4 different and independent CON arguments -- each consisting in a catchy name and a single concise statement, formatted as '**name:** statement' -- that object to the fifth proposition? Make sure each CON argument demonstrates in a specific and plausible way why proposition (P5) is false. Just denying the proposition won't do. However, keep your arguments short and direct (single sentenve). Be inspired by the domain tags above.\\nJust provide your CON arguments below (no explanations needed).\"\n",

But in logic and critical thinking, an argument is a list of statements, one of which is the conclusion while the others represent the premises or assumptions of the argument.\\n\\nTo give an argument is to provide a set of premises as reasons for accepting the conclusion. So, to give an argument does not necessarily mean to attack or criticize someone. Arguments can also be used to support other person's viewpoints.\\n\\nHere is an example of an argument:\\n\\n> If you want to find a good job, you should work hard. You do want to find a good job. So you     should work hard.\\n\\nThe first two sentences here are the premises of the argument, and the last sentence is the conclusion. To give this argument is to offer the premises as reasons for accepting the conclusion.\\n///\\nNow, the participants of a debate have previously brainstormed the following arguments:\\n\\n[\\n  {'label': Climate Concerns, 'claim': The production and consumption of meat contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, which outweigh the nutritional benefits of meat consumption. },\\n  {'label': Indian Insights, 'claim': Traditional Indian diets, which are often vegetarian or vegan, have been associated with lower rates of chronic diseases, challenging the idea that meat consumption is necessary for overall health. },\\n  {'label': Resource Inefficiency, 'claim': Meat production requires significantly more water, land, and energy than plant-based food production, making it a resource-inefficient choice for obtaining essential nutrients. },\\n  {'label': Booked on Saturated Fat, 'claim': Consuming meat can lead to an excessive intake of saturated fat, which can increase the risk of heart disease and other health problems, counterbalancing the nutritional benefits of meat. },\\n]\\n\\nwhich they've proposed as reasons CON:\\n[[B]] Meat contains major nutrients.\\nCan you please select the 2 most salient arguments of these?

But in logic and critical thinking, an argument is a list of statements, one of which is the conclusion while the others represent the premises or assumptions of the argument.\\n\\nTo give an argument is to provide a set of premises as reasons for accepting the conclusion. So, to give an argument does not necessarily mean to attack or criticize someone. Arguments can also be used to support other person's viewpoints.\\n\\nHere is an example of an argument:\\n\\n> If you want to find a good job, you should work hard. You do want to find a good job. So you     should work hard.\\n\\nThe first two sentences here are the premises of the argument, and the last sentence is the conclusion. To give this argument is to offer the premises as reasons for accepting the conclusion.\\n///\\nNow, an opponent has previously maintained in a debate that:\\n\\n  (P1) Meat contains major nutrients\\n  (P2) Consuming major nutrients is important for overall health and well-being\\n  (P3) Eating meat provides major nutrients\\n  (P4) Maintaining good health through proper nutrition is desirable\\n  (P5) The benefits of consuming meat, including the provision of major nutrients, outweigh any potential drawbacks or concerns\\n\\nHow plausible and convincing are these propositions?
