      "    \"System: You are: A foodtruck owner in Chicago..\\nYou have been chosen to assist a collaborative debating project as an external expert, given you outstanding critical thinking and argumentation skills.\\nYou read instructions carefully and follow them precisely. You give concise and clear answers.\\nHuman: Task: Provide additional supporting arguments for a given claim\\nDomain tags: climate change - animals - health\\nRead the following background information carefully before answering!\\n/// background_information\\nA crucial part of critical thinking is to identify, construct, and evaluate arguments.\\n\\nIn everyday life, people often use \\\"argument\\\" to mean a quarrel between serveral persons. But in logic and critical thinking, an argument is a list of statements, one of which is the conclusion while the others represent the premises or assumptions of the argument.\\n\\nTo give an argument is to provide a set of premises as reasons for accepting the conclusion. So, to give an argument does not necessarily mean to attack or criticize someone. Arguments can also be used to support other person's viewpoints.\\n\\nHere is an example of an argument:\\n\\n> If you want to find a good job, you should work hard. You do want to find a good job. So you     should work hard.\\n\\nThe first two sentences here are the premises of the argument, and the last sentence is the conclusion. To give this argument is to offer the premises as reasons for accepting the conclusion.\\n\\n\\nThe following are tips for drafting and writing clear and effective arguments.\\n\\nMake one point at a time:\\nThis is a really key aspect of debating! If you make multiple points in one claim, you risk creating confusion and obscuring parts of your arguments. Examples are often better placed as their own pro claims beneath a claim, rather than integrated into it.\\n\\nKeep claims short, simple and to the point:\\nAvoid introductory statements, restatements, and, in most cases “hedging language”. These are common ways that we communicate when talking out loud or writing a long-form piece – and absolutely have their uses – but are ill-suited to the bite-sized structure of a debate.\\n\\nKeep claims directly relevant to their parent:\\nIf a claim doesn't fit anywhere in the discussion yet, there are probably some other claims you'll need to create first! Claims should directly support or weaken their parent claims / propositions.\\n\\nUse research, evidence and facts to support your claims:\\nYou can link directly to external sources when they back up the points you're making. But only do so when you're sure you know exactly what the source says and that it supports your point. If you're not sure, it's better to leave it out.\\n\\nUse logic to support your claims:\\nJust throwing an idea out there is rarely persuasive! Even if you're dealing in an area where there's a lack of research and evidence available, you can still explain the logical links that lead you to draw the conclusions you're drawing. Meanwhile, keep an eye out for logical fallacies.\\n\\n///\\nNow, a participant has previously maintained in a debate that:\\n\\n  (P1) Meat contains major nutrients\\n  (P2) Consuming major nutrients is important for overall health and well-being\\n  (P3) Eating meat provides major nutrients\\n  (P4) Maintaining good health through proper nutrition is desirable\\n  (P5) The benefits of consuming meat, including the provision of major nutrients, outweigh any potential drawbacks or concerns\\n\\nCan you provide up to 4 different and independent PRO arguments -- each consisting in a catchy name and a single concise statement, formatted as '**name:** statement' -- that back up the first proposition? Make sure your arguments argue for proposition (P1) in specific and plausible ways without merely repeating that proposition. Keep your arguments short and direct. Be inspired by the domain tags above.\\nJust provide your supporting arguments below.\"\n",

      "    \"System: You are: A foodtruck owner in Chicago..\\nYou have been chosen to assist a collaborative debating project as an external expert, given you outstanding critical thinking and argumentation skills.\\nYou read instructions carefully and follow them precisely. You give concise and clear answers.\\nHuman: Task: Provide objections against a given claim\\nDomain tags: climate change - books - India\\nRead the following background information carefully before answering!\\n/// background_information\\nA crucial part of critical thinking is to identify, construct, and evaluate arguments.\\n\\nIn everyday life, people often use \\\"argument\\\" to mean a quarrel between serveral persons. But in logic and critical thinking, an argument is a list of statements, one of which is the conclusion while the others represent the premises or assumptions of the argument.\\n\\nTo give an argument is to provide a set of premises as reasons for accepting the conclusion. So, to give an argument does not necessarily mean to attack or criticize someone. Arguments can also be used to support other person's viewpoints.\\n\\nHere is an example of an argument:\\n\\n> If you want to find a good job, you should work hard. You do want to find a good job. So you     should work hard.\\n\\nThe first two sentences here are the premises of the argument, and the last sentence is the conclusion. To give this argument is to offer the premises as reasons for accepting the conclusion.\\n\\n\\nThe following are tips for drafting and writing clear and effective arguments.\\n\\nMake one point at a time:\\nThis is a really key aspect of debating! If you make multiple points in one claim, you risk creating confusion and obscuring parts of your arguments. Examples are often better placed as their own pro claims beneath a claim, rather than integrated into it.\\n\\nKeep claims short, simple and to the point:\\nAvoid introductory statements, restatements, and, in most cases “hedging language”. These are common ways that we communicate when talking out loud or writing a long-form piece – and absolutely have their uses – but are ill-suited to the bite-sized structure of a debate.\\n\\nKeep claims directly relevant to their parent:\\nIf a claim doesn't fit anywhere in the discussion yet, there are probably some other claims you'll need to create first! Claims should directly support or weaken their parent claims / propositions.\\n\\nUse research, evidence and facts to support your claims:\\nYou can link directly to external sources when they back up the points you're making. But only do so when you're sure you know exactly what the source says and that it supports your point. If you're not sure, it's better to leave it out.\\n\\nUse logic to support your claims:\\nJust throwing an idea out there is rarely persuasive! Even if you're dealing in an area where there's a lack of research and evidence available, you can still explain the logical links that lead you to draw the conclusions you're drawing. Meanwhile, keep an eye out for logical fallacies.\\n\\n///\\nNow, back to your task. An opponent in a debate has previously maintained that:\\n\\n  (P1) Meat contains major nutrients\\n  (P2) Consuming major nutrients is important for overall health and well-being\\n  (P3) Eating meat provides major nutrients\\n  (P4) Maintaining good health through proper nutrition is desirable\\n  (P5) The benefits of consuming meat, including the provision of major nutrients, outweigh any potential drawbacks or concerns\\n\\nCan you provide up to 4 different and independent CON arguments -- each consisting in a catchy name and a single concise statement, formatted as '**name:** statement' -- that object to the fifth proposition? Make sure each CON argument demonstrates in a specific and plausible way why proposition (P5) is false. Just denying the proposition won't do. However, keep your arguments short and direct (single sentenve). Be inspired by the domain tags above.\\nJust provide your CON arguments below (no explanations needed).\"\n",

Moreover, you're an experienced debater, having won major debates and served as judge in numerous debating competitions. When not serving as an assistant and advisor, you're teaching formal logic and critical thinking in Stanford's philosophy programs.\\nYou read instructions carefully and follow them precisely. You give concise and clear answers.\\nHuman: Task: Identify the 2 most salient CON arguments.\\nRead the following background information carefully before answering!\\n/// background_information\\nA crucial part of critical thinking is to identify, construct, and evaluate arguments.\\n\\nIn everyday life, people often use \\\"argument\\\" to mean a quarrel between serveral persons. But in logic and critical thinking, an argument is a list of statements, one of which is the conclusion while the others represent the premises or assumptions of the argument.\\n\\nTo give an argument is to provide a set of premises as reasons for accepting the conclusion. So, to give an argument does not necessarily mean to attack or criticize someone. Arguments can also be used to support other person's viewpoints.\\n\\nHere is an example of an argument:\\n\\n> If you want to find a good job, you should work hard. You do want to find a good job. So you     should work hard.\\n\\nThe first two sentences here are the premises of the argument, and the last sentence is the conclusion. To give this argument is to offer the premises as reasons for accepting the conclusion.\\n///\\nNow, the participants of a debate have previously brainstormed the following arguments:\\n\\n[\\n  {'label': Environmental Impact, 'claim': The production of meat contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and water pollution, outweighing the benefits of its nutritional value. },\\n  {'label': Animal Welfare, 'claim': The meat industry's animal cruelty, mistreatment, and inhumane practices are a moral concern that outweighs the nutritional benefits of consuming meat. },\\n  {'label': Resource Inefficiency, 'claim': Producing meat requires significantly more resources (land, water, and energy) than plant-based alternatives, making it an inefficient use of resources that outweighs its nutritional benefits. },\\n  {'label': Health Risks, 'claim': Consuming excessive amounts of red and processed meat has been linked to increased risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers, which outweigh the potential benefits of its nutritional value. },\\n]\\n\\nwhich they've proposed as reasons CON:\\n[[B]] Meat contains major nutrients.\\nCan you please select the 2 most salient arguments of these? Please ensure that you identify diverse and mutually independent arguments. Format your selection of the 2 arguments as follows:\\n```json\\n[\\n    {\\\"idx\\\": 1, \\\"label\\\": \\\"<Insert argument label here.>\\\", \\\"claim\\\": \\\"<Insert argument gist here.>\\\"},\\n    {\\\"idx\\\": 2, \\\"label\\\": \\\"<Insert argument label here.>\\\", \\\"claim\\\": \\\"<Insert argument gist here.>\\\"},\\n    ...\\n]\\n```\\nJust return the JSON code.\"\n",

So, to give an argument does not necessarily mean to attack or criticize someone. Arguments can also be used to support other person's viewpoints.\\n\\nHere is an example of an argument:\\n\\n> If you want to find a good job, you should work hard. You do want to find a good job. So you     should work hard.\\n\\nThe first two sentences here are the premises of the argument, and the last sentence is the conclusion.

      "[None]: Museums should be free for everyone.\n",
      "  + [Knowledge Equity]: Free museums promote equal access to knowledge, a fundamental human right, by bridging the information gap between those who can afford education and those who cannot.\n",
      "    + [Informed Society]: A well-informed population is better equipped to make informed decisions, participate in the democratic process, and hold those in power accountable, making knowledge a fundamental right.\n",
      "    + [Freedom of Thought]: Knowledge is the foundation of critical thinking, and the ability to think critically is essential for individual freedom and autonomy, making knowledge a fundamental human right.\n",
      "    - [Museum Misconception]: Museums are not widely accessible, especially in rural or underprivileged areas, undermining the notion that they provide equal access to knowledge for all.\n",
      "    - [Privileged Pursuit]: Museums often focus on specific, niche topics, catering to a limited audience with the means and interest to explore such areas of knowledge, making them an exclusive source of education rather than a universal one.\n",
      "  + [Social Inclusion through Art]: Free museums provide a universal platform for people to engage with art and culture, regardless of their socioeconomic background, thus promoting social cohesion and a sense of shared human experience.\n",
      "    + [Social Harmony]: A society with a strong sense of shared human experience through art and culture is more likely to resolve conflicts peacefully, as it fosters empathy and understanding.\n",
      "    + [Economic Benefits]: A unified, socially cohesive society can foster a sense of national pride and identity, which in turn can boost local economies through increased tourism, cultural exports, and community-driven initiatives.\n",
      "    - [Digital Divide]: Online access is not a substitute for physical museum experience, and the digital divide may exacerbate the existing socioeconomic disparities in cultural engagement.\n",
      "    - [Racism in Art]: A universal platform for people to engage with art and culture may not address the existing racial biases in the curation and presentation of art, potentially reinforcing rather than eradicating social inequalities.\n",
      "  - [Fiscal Realism]: Museums need funding to maintain their collections and provide educational programs, and free admission would drastically reduce their ability to secure such funding.\n",
      "    + [Preservation Priority]: Museums' primary goal is to preserve cultural heritage, and securing funding is crucial for this purpose.\n",
      "    + [Preservation Premium]: Museums require funding to employ conservators who meticulously preserve priceless artifacts, ensuring their longevity and integrity for future generations.\n",
      "    - [Europa's Free Model]: Many European museums, such as the Prado in Madrid, have successfully implemented free admission policies without experiencing a significant decline in funding, contradicting the assumption that free admission would drastically reduce museum funding.\n",
      "    - [Mexican Museums Thrive]: Mexico's National Museum of Anthropology sees record-breaking attendance and financial support despite offering free admission on certain days, debunking the idea that free admission necessarily leads to reduced funding.\n",
      "  - [Crowd Control]: Making all museums free would lead to overcrowding, potentially diminishing the quality of the visitor experience and the ability of staff to provide adequate guidance and services.\n",
      "    + [Admission Revenue Loss]: Museums rely on ticket sales for a significant portion of their operational budget. By waiving admission fees, they would forego a crucial source of revenue, making it harder to manage visitor numbers and maintain a high-quality experience.\n",
      "    + [Limited Resources]: With the potential influx of visitors, museums would be forced to allocate limited resources (staff, exhibits, maintenance) inefficiently, leading to inadequate facilities and services, thereby increasing the likelihood of overcrowding.\n",
      "    - [Museum Specialization]: Some museums focus on specific, niche topics, requiring specialized staff with unique expertise, making it difficult to find sufficient staff for general guidance and services if museums were to maintain a broad range of exhibits.\n",
      "    - [Tourism Industry Flexibility]: Many museums are part of larger tourism attractions and events, flexibly adjusting their services and operations to accommodate varying visitor numbers, and would likely adapt to free admission without compromising staff's ability to provide good guidance and services.\n"
